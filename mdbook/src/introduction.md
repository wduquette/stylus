# Introduction to Stylus

The `stylus` tool is a multi-tool for a variety of tasks, and an incubator
for new capabilities.

- Scripted drawing to PNG images using the JavaFX `GraphicsContext`
- Scripted drawing to monospaced text, for output to the terminal
- Working with fictional calendar systems
- Working with "historical" events and timelines

Some of these features, once mature, will become part of the Joe
language's standard library.
