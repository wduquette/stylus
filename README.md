# Stylus Multi-Tool

Stylus is a multi-tool, providing a number of tools I find useful for
writing and documentation, and probably some other things as well.  When
complete, it will have:

- The ability to wrangle fictional calendars, including multiple calendars
  for a single setting.
- The ability to manage and query Nero databases of history data,
  fictional and real, and produce various outputs, including
  graphical and textual timelines.
- Various scripted drawing tools.

Stylus uses [Joe](https://github.com/wduquette/joe) as its scripting 
language, and Nero Datalog (included with Joe) as its data file format.

See the Stylus user's guide for more information.
